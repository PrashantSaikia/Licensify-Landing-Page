# 📊 Licensify Analytics Setup Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Database Tables

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor"
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `backend/analytics-schema.sql`
4. Click "Run" to create the tables and functions

## Step 2: Deploy Updated Code

1. Commit and push all the changes to your repository
2. Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy (1-2 minutes)

## Step 3: Test the Analytics

1. Visit your landing page - this will track a page visit
2. Submit an email - this will track a conversion
3. Check the browser console for analytics logs

## 📍 Where to Check Real-Time Conversion Rates

### Option 1: Analytics Dashboard (Recommended)
**URL:** `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/backend/analytics-dashboard.html`

Features:
- 📊 Real-time conversion rates (overall + today)
- 🔄 Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- 📈 Total visitors and signups
- 🎯 Visual dashboard interface

### Option 2: Browser Console (Landing Page)
1. Open your landing page
2. Press F12 → Console tab
3. Look for logs like:
   ```
   📊 REAL-TIME ANALYTICS: {overall: {...}, today: {...}}
   🎯 Overall Conversion Rate: 25.5% (15/59)
   📅 Today's Conversion Rate: 33.3% (3/9)
   ```

### Option 3: Console Commands
On your landing page, run these commands in the browser console:

```javascript
// Get full analytics dashboard
await window.getLicensifyAnalytics()

// Get just the conversion rate
await window.getConversionRate()

// Check stored analytics data
window.licensifyAnalytics
```

### Option 4: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor" 
3. Run these queries:

```sql
-- Get conversion rate
SELECT get_conversion_rate();

-- Get full analytics dashboard
SELECT get_analytics_dashboard();

-- Check raw data
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as visitors FROM page_visits;
SELECT COUNT(*) as signups FROM early_access_emails;
```

## 📈 What Gets Tracked

### Database Tables

#### 1. `page_visits` table ✅ (Active)
- Unique session IDs (not cookies)
- User agent information
- Referrer sources
- Timestamps

#### 2. `early_access_emails` table ✅ (Active)
- Email addresses (your existing table)
- Signup timestamps
- Source tracking

#### 3. `daily_stats` table ⚠️ (Empty - Optional)
- **Status**: Currently empty (not auto-populated)
- **Purpose**: Daily aggregated statistics for performance optimization
- **Population**: Requires manual setup (see below)

### Conversion Rate Calculation
```
Conversion Rate = (Email Signups / Unique Visitors) × 100
```

**Note**: Analytics are calculated in real-time from raw data, so the `daily_stats` table is optional.

### 🔄 Daily Stats Population (Optional)

If you want to populate the `daily_stats` table with daily summaries:

1. **Manual Option**: Run `backend/daily-stats-update.sql` daily in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Automated Option**: Set up a Supabase Edge Function with cron scheduling
3. **Skip Option**: Keep using real-time calculations (recommended for most users)

The current implementation works perfectly without the `daily_stats` table!

## 🔄 Real-Time Updates

Analytics update automatically when:
- ✅ Someone visits your landing page
- ✅ Someone submits their email
- ✅ You refresh the analytics dashboard
- ✅ You run console commands

## 🛡️ Privacy & GDPR Compliance

- ✅ No personal data stored in analytics
- ✅ Session IDs are anonymous
- ✅ IP addresses optional (set to null by default)
- ✅ No cookies used for tracking
- ✅ Compliant with privacy regulations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Conversion Rate Shows 0%

- Try submitting a test email (creates conversion)
- Check that page visits are being tracked in Supabase

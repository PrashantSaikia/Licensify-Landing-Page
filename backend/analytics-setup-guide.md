# 📊 Licensify Analytics Setup Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Database Tables

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor"
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `backend/analytics-schema.sql`
4. Click "Run" to create the tables and functions

## Step 2: Deploy Updated Code

1. Commit and push all the changes to your repository
2. Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy (1-2 minutes)

## Step 3: Test the Analytics

1. Visit your landing page - this will track a page visit
2. Submit an email - this will track a conversion
3. Check the browser console for analytics logs

## 🌍 Geographic Tracking Feature

### Overview
Your Licensify analytics includes **automatic geographic tracking** for website visitors! This feature uses IP geolocation to determine visitor countries and cities without requiring any user permissions or location access.

### What's New

#### 1. **Automatic Geographic Detection**
- Visitors' countries and cities are automatically detected using their IP addresses
- Uses the free ipapi.co service (no API keys required)
- Completely privacy-friendly - no location permissions needed
- Geographic information is stored alongside other visit data

#### 2. **Enhanced Database Schema**
- Added `country` and `city` fields to the `page_visits` table
- New `get_country_stats()` and `get_city_stats()` functions for geographic analytics
- Optimized with database indexes for fast queries

#### 3. **Updated Analytics Dashboard**
- New "Visitor Countries" section showing country distribution
- New "Visitor Cities" section showing city distribution
- Displays top 10 countries and top 8 cities with visitor counts and percentages
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- Clean, professional styling matching your brand

#### 4. **Geographic Console Commands**
Access geographic statistics directly from your browser console:
```javascript
// Get country statistics
getCountryStats()

// Get city statistics
getCityStats()

// Get overall analytics (existing)
getAnalytics()
```

### How Geographic Tracking Works

1. **Page Visit**: When someone visits your website
2. **IP Geolocation**: System automatically detects their country and city using IP address
3. **Database Storage**: Geographic info stored with visit data
4. **Analytics Display**: Country and city statistics shown in dashboard

### Privacy & Compliance

✅ **No user permissions required** - IP geolocation is automatic  
✅ **GDPR compliant** - Only country-level data, not precise location  
✅ **Transparent** - No hidden tracking or cookies for this feature  
✅ **Graceful fallback** - If country detection fails, visit is still tracked  

### Database Migration for Geographic Tracking

If you're updating an existing installation, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add country and city columns to existing page_visits table
ALTER TABLE page_visits ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS country TEXT;
ALTER TABLE page_visits ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;

-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_visits_country ON page_visits(country);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_visits_city ON page_visits(city);
```

## 📍 Where to Check Real-Time Conversion Rates

### Option 1: Analytics Dashboard (Recommended)
**URL:** `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/backend/analytics-dashboard.html`

Features:
- 📊 Real-time conversion rates (overall + today)
- 🔄 Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- 📈 Total visitors and signups
- 🎯 Visual dashboard interface
- 🌍 Geographic statistics (countries and cities)

### Option 2: Browser Console (Landing Page)
1. Open your landing page
2. Press F12 → Console tab
3. Look for logs like:
   ```
   📊 REAL-TIME ANALYTICS: {overall: {...}, today: {...}}
   🎯 Overall Conversion Rate: 25.5% (15/59)
   📅 Today's Conversion Rate: 33.3% (3/9)
   ```

### Option 3: Console Commands
On your landing page, run these commands in the browser console:

```javascript
// Get full analytics dashboard
await window.getLicensifyAnalytics()

// Get just the conversion rate
await window.getConversionRate()

// Get country statistics
getCountryStats()

// Get city statistics
getCityStats()

// Check stored analytics data
window.licensifyAnalytics
```

### Option 4: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor" 
3. Run these queries:

```sql
-- Get conversion rate
SELECT get_conversion_rate();

-- Get full analytics dashboard
SELECT get_analytics_dashboard();

-- Get country statistics
SELECT get_country_stats();

-- Get city statistics
SELECT get_city_stats();

-- Check raw data
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as visitors FROM page_visits;
SELECT COUNT(*) as signups FROM early_access_emails;
```

## 📈 What Gets Tracked

### Database Tables

#### 1. `page_visits` table ✅ (Active)
- Unique session IDs (not cookies)
- User agent information
- Referrer sources
- Timestamps
- **Geographic data**: Country and city information (automatic)

#### 2. `early_access_emails` table ✅ (Active)
- Email addresses (your existing table)
- Signup timestamps
- Source tracking

#### 3. `daily_stats` table ⚠️ (Empty - Optional)
- **Status**: Currently empty (not auto-populated)
- **Purpose**: Daily aggregated statistics for performance optimization
- **Population**: Requires manual setup (see below)

### Conversion Rate Calculation
```
Conversion Rate = (Email Signups / Unique Visitors) × 100
```

**Note**: Analytics are calculated in real-time from raw data, so the `daily_stats` table is optional.

### Geographic Data Collection
- **IP Service**: Uses ipapi.co (free, reliable, no auth required)
- **Fallback**: If geographic detection fails, `null` values are stored (no impact on other analytics)
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - location lookup happens in parallel with page tracking
- **Data Retention**: Geographic data follows same retention policy as other visit data
- **Display**: Countries show top 10, cities show top 8 for optimal dashboard readability

### 🔄 Daily Stats Population (Optional)

If you want to populate the `daily_stats` table with daily summaries:

1. **Manual Option**: Run `backend/daily-stats-update.sql` daily in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Automated Option**: Set up a Supabase Edge Function with cron scheduling
3. **Skip Option**: Keep using real-time calculations (recommended for most users)

The current implementation works perfectly without the `daily_stats` table!

## 🔄 Real-Time Updates

Analytics update automatically when:
- ✅ Someone visits your landing page
- ✅ Someone submits their email
- ✅ You refresh the analytics dashboard
- ✅ You run console commands

## 🛡️ Privacy & GDPR Compliance

- ✅ No personal data stored in analytics
- ✅ Session IDs are anonymous
- ✅ IP addresses optional (set to null by default)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Loading..." Never Changes
- Check your Supabase configuration in `config.js`
- Verify the SQL functions were created successfully
- Check browser console for errors

### Conversion Rate Shows 0%
- Make sure you've visited the landing page (creates visitor)
- Try submitting a test email (creates conversion)
- Check that page visits are being tracked in Supabase

### Dashboard Not Loading
- Ensure `config.js` is in the same directory as the dashboard
- Check that Supabase credentials are correct
- Verify Row Level Security policies are set up

### Geographic Data Not Showing
- Check browser console for IP geolocation errors
- Verify the `get_country_stats()` and `get_city_stats()` functions exist in Supabase
- Note that some IP addresses may not resolve to locations (this is normal)

   - Mailchimp API
   - ConvertKit
   - Netlify Forms
   - Custom backend endpoint

### Email Storage Code Location

Look for this function in `script.js`:

```javascript
function storeEmail(email) {
    // Replace this with your actual API call
    let emails = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('licensifyEmails') || '[]');
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
